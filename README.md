# MSTU-5003-Final

This is my final project for MSTU-5003: Theory/Programming Interactive Media at Teachers College, Columbia University. It's the beginnings of a browser game intended to teach news and civic media literacy strategies to middle and high school students.

Users find keywords in articles presented and search for other content that might lead them to clues about whether the article is real, fake, or misleading in some way.
